## Milestone 1 (7th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).


### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

Our interactive data visualization aims to provide a unique way of exploring natural disasters that hae occured around the globe over the past century. Instead of a static map, we have designed an immersive experience that allows the user to become a pilot and fly around the world to visit different locations where natural disasters have occured. This approach adds an element of excitement and exploration to the visualization, making it more engaging for the user.

To ensure that the user can explore the data effectively, we have integrated the tempporal aspect of the data into the simulation. THe user will be able to control the speed of the simulation, pause it, or even reverse it. This functionalityu allows the user to investigate the data at their own pace and gain a deeper understanding of how nautral disasters have evolved over time.

For the spatial aspect of the data, the user will be able to fly around the glode using the plane controls. As the user navigates through different regions of the world, they will be able to see the types of natural disasters that have occured in each location. For example, they may fly over a region that has experienced multiple earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods. 

Overall, we believe that this approach to data visualization will attracts users who are curious and interested in exploring the world around them. It is not intended to be a quick summary of all natural disasters, but rather an immersive experience that encourages the user to engage with the data and explore it at their own pace. By creating a visualizatoin that is interactive and engaging, we hope to provide users with a deeper understanding of natural disasters and their impact on the world.



### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
